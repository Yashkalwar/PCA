# PCA
principle component analysis
PCA application sample for analysis of stock markets using python

PCA is a mathematical method for compressing multidimensional data into a less dimensional version. That data reduction helps to make analysis more simpler. More information about principle component analysis and its math is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) . With this project I tried to analyse stock market data with PCA decomposition.

Data
I used "Borsa Istanbul 100" a.k.a. "Bist100" stock market index symbols. It is an index of Turkey stocks that covers top 100 biggest components. Gathered 5 basic financial ratios for each symbol around internet.
